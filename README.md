# aiohttp_loadbalancer
A little private project of a loadbalancer enterely written in python3 with aiohttp 


This is a project made for fun and to explore asyncio and aiohttp server features.
THIS IS NOT CREATED FOR PRODUCTION USE OR ANY KIND OF SERIUS PROJECT
IT'S JUST FOR FUN

Anyone is welcome to contribute to this repo, but don't be too hard on me, I programmed this in 2 / 3 hours from scratch.
